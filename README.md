# CS598-DLH-FinalProject

No additional steps required before running the code in the notebook. Just run the code cells in the notebook in order from top to bottom. 
You may need to install some packages. I commented out the "pip install" commands that you may need to run. Otherwise, if you run this in Google Colab, most of the packages should already be installed in the runtime environment. 

I mentioned this in my results section as well, but you will probably not get the exact same accuracy results as I did, but your numbers should be fairly close to what I described.
